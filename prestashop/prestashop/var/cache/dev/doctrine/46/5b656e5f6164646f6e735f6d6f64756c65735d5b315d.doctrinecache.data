You know that this selection is appropriate and that it will appeal to your customers.</div><div> </div><div>Or you could even use your best-sellers, by adding them to those that are less visible, to allow your customers to discover them.</div><div> </div><div>Your packs will need to be made up of 2 products minimum, the number is unlimited.</div><div>Push the quantity per product, choose the combinations of your choice, there are multiple options allowing you to multiply the possibilities.</div><div> </div><div>Would you like to reserve the purchase of a product within a pack?</div><div>That is also possible! You will therefore be able <strong>to offer a free product</strong> if it is purchased as part of a pack. The possibilities are infinite!</div><div> </div><div><strong>Integrated assistant</strong></div><div> </div><div>It isn't always obvious deciding which products should be offered within a pack. Here again <strong>Advanced Pack</strong> has the solution to the problem.</div><div>When creating your pack, our module will supply you with strategic information, like the number of products sold or their available stock.</div><div> </div><div>There is also an integrated <strong>dynamic price simulator</strong> for your pack, to help you see more clearly when creating your business operation.</div><div> </div><div><strong>Remain the maestro of combinations</strong></div><div> </div><div>One of the products that you have added to your pack is available in several colors, but you don't want to offer them all in this set?</div><div><strong>Advanced Pack</strong> will allow you to do this.</div><div> </div><div>You will also have the possibility of predefining a combination by default, for each of the products of your pack, even if it's different to the one defined in your catalog.</div><div> </div><div>Your customers will then be able to <strong>personalise their selection</strong> amongst the characteristics that you will have chosen to integrate in the offer.</div><div> </div><div><strong>Business Incentive</strong></div><div> </div><div>Incentive is something that motivates your visitor to make a purchase The main aim is to convince more of your site visitors to finish their order and/or <strong>spend more money per transaction</strong>.</div><div>Perhaps you have already tried, by offering free delivery over a certain amount of purchases, or to offer discounts on certain products or even to send discount vouchers?</div><div>All of these methods work, but their range is limited, as these promotions are usually temporary due to their excessive cost!</div><div><strong>Stop looking, you have already found the solution !</strong></div><div> </div><div>To entice your customers, <strong>Advanced Pack</strong> will give you the choice of applying a discount when all the products in the shopping cart are ordered, thus encouraging the purchase of the whole pack.</div><div> </div><div><strong>3 possibilities are available: </strong></div><ul>	<li>Offer a specific discount on <strong>each product</strong> in the pack</li>	<li>Apply a general discount on <strong>the set of products</strong></li>	<li>Apply a <strong>fixed price</strong>, such as a psychological price, for example</li></ul><div> </div><div><strong>Advanced Pack</strong> will also be able to manage the discounts already applied to your products, allowing you to integrate them in the pack price, or on the contrary, to exclude them, in order to choose the predefined discount on the pack.</div><div>This decision will be made even easier thanks to our <strong>clear and clean-looking interface</strong>, that will allow you to see the discounted products very easily.</div><div> </div><div><strong>You won't need to worry about the coherence of your prices anymore</strong></div><div> </div><div>Have you ever had to review all the prices in your catalog, to detect any possible incoherences and correct them? What would happen if you had to manually manage the repercussions of these changes in product pricing in your packs? This would represent a significant extra workload if if it's not anticipated within the choice of management solutions within your packs!</div><div> </div><div>Once again <strong>Advanced Pack</strong> has the solution.</div><div> </div><div>By default, in the case where no reduction has been applied, the pack price is the sum of the products making it up.</div><div>Should you need to modify the price of a product after having created the pack, <strong>the pack price will automatically be updated</strong>, and without you having to intervene.</div><div> </div><div>In those cases where you will apply a discount to one or more products in an existing pack, and on condition you have authorized the <strong>promotional implications</strong>, the pack price will also be changed, showing your customers the discount that has been applied.</div><div> </div><div>Is one of the products of your pack subject to an green-tax? No problem, it will automatically be reflected in the pack price and will be clearly stated, guaranteeing absolute <strong>respect for the legislation</strong>.</div><div> </div><div><strong>Regarding the management of your stock, everything has been automated!</strong></div><div> </div><div>For each pack ordered, the product stocks it contains will be <strong>automatically deducted</strong>. This way you will avoid the double management of stock or the frustration generated by sales rendered impossible, due to the bad assignation of quantities.</div><div>Also, in the case where a product in a pack is out of stock, it will <strong>automatically be displayed as unavailable</strong> for purchase thanks to an availability warning system that is both elegant and modern.</div><div> </div><div>For your customers, we have integrated a graphic and fun notification system, allowing the instant identification of stock shortages on combinations or products making up the pack. <strong>There's no chance of you receiving orders for products that are out of stock !</strong></div><div> </div><div><strong>Highlight your packs and sell more</strong></div><div> </div><div>Once you have defined your pack, you will be able to configure it in the same way as you would a classic product. Everything is possible, such as assigning it customized images, classing it in the category of your choice, <strong>optimizing your SEO</strong>, writing a customized description, attributing it an EAN code or a specific reference, configuring its volume to calculate delivery costs, etc...</div><div> </div><div>For those that are pressed for time, and in order to facilitate their marketing, <strong>Advanced Pack</strong> will automatically display all the photos of the products that make it up, as well as their descriptions, in the form of tabs.</div><div>Your customers will be correctly informed, without leaving the page of your pack, and <strong>able to finalise their purchase in one click</strong>.</div><div> </div><div>And that's not all... For more visibility, your packs will automatically be <strong>highlighted on their data sheets</strong> for those being sold in lots</div><div>This way, you will encourage your customers to order the pack, rather than the product they were initially interested in. Essentially, this is <strong>cross-selling</strong>: an accessible method of <strong>increasing your average shopping cart</strong> !</div><div> </div><div><strong>We don't forget designers</strong></div><div> </div><div>From the beginning, we have integrated the fact that this module should be easily adapted by your web agency or designer/integrator.</div><div>The module adapts itself perfectly to the default PrestaShop 1.6 and 1.7 themes, whilst allowing the most advanced graphic personalization.</div><div> </div><div>A set of JavaScript templates and CSS style sheets are delivered as models with the module, <strong>to facilitate the integration process</strong>. Either yourself or your integrator will therefore be able to use all of the functionalities of the <strong>Advanced Pack 5</strong> engine, in order to present them in the graphic form that will best correspond with the general atmosphere of your online store.</div>";s:3:"tab";s:13:"merchandizing";s:7:"version";s:6:"5.2.11";s:13:"compatibility";O:8:"stdClass":2:{s:4:"from";s:7:"1.6.1.0";s:2:"to";s:7:"1.7.6.9";}s:7:"nbRates";s:3:"207";s:12:"product_type";s:6:"module";s:7:"avgRate";s:3:"4.0";s:5:"price";O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:3:"EUR";d:299.99000000000001;s:3:"USD";d:369.99000000000001;s:3:"GBP";d:279.99000000000001;}s:6:"badges";a:1:{i:0;O:8:"stdClass":2:{s:5:"label";s:23:"Modules Partner Creator";s:3:"img";s:93:"https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png";}}s:5:"cover";O:8:"stdClass":2:{s:5:"small";s:91:"https://medias1.prestastore.com/616235-pprod/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg";s:3:"big";s:90:"https://medias1.prestastore.com/616235-pbig/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg";}s:9:"changeLog";O:8:"stdClass":28:{s:5:"5.0.0";a:1:{i:0;s:28:"Initial Release (new module)";}s:5:"5.0.1";a:14:{i:0;s:104:"New: Let a customer to remove a product from a pack (pack must have no discount and at least 3 products)";i:1;s:50:"New: Remove limitation of 2 products mini per pack";i:2;s:63:"New: Better stock management and available quantity calculation";i:3;s:43:"New: Add quantity wanted input on pack page";i:4;s:108:"New: Add view & buy this pack button toggle for cross selling block (+ background color & text color option)";i:5;s:76:"New: Add new option in order to change icons color (plus, remove, reinstate)";i:6;s:64:"New: Add option to only show images from the current combination";i:7;s:28:"Fix: Pack weight calculation";i:8;s:63:"Fix: 404 error on pack update/add on old PrestaShop 1.5 version";i:9;s:34:"Fix: Use "Free" instead of price 0";i:10;s:47:"Fix: Price showing but should not in some cases";i:11;s:109:"Fix: Product accessories and attachments variables for each product of the pack are now available to template";i:12;s:46:"Fix: Filter images that are only "really used"";i:13;s:58:"Fix: Hide pack that aren't active into cross selling block";}s:5:"5.0.2";a:1:{i:0;s:40:"Major fixes and some nice improvements !";}s:5:"5.0.3";a:5:{i:0;s:100:"Fix wrong price calculation for buy block when not using default combinations and using price impact";i:1;s:92:"Fix product selection (auto complete) when no pack are already created (PrestaShop 1.6.0.11)";i:2;s:59:"Fix tab alert when adding new product (PrestaShop 1.6.0.11)";i:3;s:45:"Fix "no available carrier" into shopping cart";i:4;s:68:"Fix pack update on combination change when there is only one product";}s:5:"5.0.4";a:9:{i:0;s:68:"New: Add "Pack  -

Then, you make the most of your Facebook community to boost the traffic on your PrestaShop site.</div><div> </div><div>Contrary to the native shop tab, that has many constraints, the "Advanced Shop for Fan Page" module allows you to:</div><div> </div><ul>	<li>create a <strong>completely customized</strong> Facebook shop, whether in terms of design, menu type or display</li>	<li>create a <strong>multilingual and multicurrency</strong> shop</li>	<li><strong>not need to submit your products to Facebook for review</strong> in order to make them visible for the public</li>	<li>make the PrestaShop website's modifications <strong>instantly visible</strong> on the Facebook shop (changes of price, product image,...)</li>	<li>display <strong>featured categories</strong> on the home page</li>	<li>display on Facebook <strong>the average rating</strong> of each product/category, given on your site (with the shape of stars) if you also have installed on your Prestashop our product rating "Customer Ratings and Reviews Pro + Google Rich Snippets" module (available here: https://addons.prestashop.com/en/seo-natural-search-engine-optimization/6144-customer-ratings-and-reviews-pro-google-rich-snippets.html)</li></ul><div> </div><div> </div><div><strong>Notes:</strong></div><div> </div><div>(x) 1/ So that real-time harmonization between Facebook and your online store is possible, the module has to create a new custom "shop" tab, <strong>independent of the default "shop" tab already installed by Facebook</strong> on your page.</div><div> </div><div>2/ if you want to create <strong>Facebook catalogs and tag your products on Facebook and Instagram,</strong> you should choose our <strong>"Dynamic Ads + Pixel"</strong> module instead, that is available here: https://addons.prestashop.com/en/remarketing-shopping-cart-abandonment/23671-dynamic-ads-pixel.html.</div><div> </div><div>3/ Facebook mobile app <strong>does not allow custom tabs insertion,</strong> like the one created by our module. Therefore, this latter can <strong>only</strong> be displayed on the Facebook web version. <strong>If you want to see your Facebook shop on mobile,</strong> you have to choose our <strong>"Dynamic Ads + Pixel"</strong> module (available here: https://addons.prestashop.com/en/remarketing-shopping-cart-abandonment/23671-dynamic-ads-pixel.html) in order to import your products into the native Facebook shop tab (however you will not be able to customize the shop).</div><div> </div><div> </div><div>To know more about the difference between the Facebook native shop tab (and filled by our "Dynamic Ads + Pixel" module) and the custom tab set by our "Advanced Shop for Fan Page" module, read our detailed comparison at this address:

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>With over a decade of success, our Google Merchant Center (Google Shopping) module is by far the most robust and complete Google Shopping module on the market. Far ahead of its competitors, our module is recommended by the largest e-commerce agencies, on the one hand for its simplicity of configuration and on the other hand for the guarantee of exporting to Google Merchant Center a high quality data feed that meets all Google&#39;s requirements.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>We started from a simple observation: the performance of your Google Shopping ads depends largely on the completeness of the product feed data. The more information you send, the better the results! This&nbsp;<strong>comprehensive</strong>&nbsp;module allows you to&nbsp;<strong>maximize your chances of getting good rankings on Google Shopping</strong>&nbsp;while&nbsp;<strong>minimizing the time</strong>&nbsp;you need to invest in order to achieve this result.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The module has been developed to allow you to create, step by step, a product data feed for which you are in control of the information. We have included, throughout the configuration, links to precise and complete documentation based on Google&#39;s official regulations. You quickly get a clear product data file that you can export to Google Merchant Center and which you can schedule to be updated automatically at the desired frequency.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Any questions? Our support department has&nbsp;<strong>many years of experience and a high level of expertise regarding the rather strict constraints and demands of Google Merchant Center,</strong>&nbsp;and will be happy to answer your questions in the best possible way!</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><strong>Make increments, reductions (discounts) and fixed prices with an unlimited conditions and combinations.&nbsp;</strong></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><strong>You can modify your product prices, massively or individually, as you prefer.</strong></div>
";s:21:"additionalDescription";s:9647:"<div><strong>Change the product prices massively</strong></div>

<div>You can change the price of the products massively, setting an increment, a discount or a fixed price using these conditions:</div>

<div>- Category</div>

<div>- Product</div>

<div>- Customer group</div>

<div>- Customer</div>

<div>- Country</div>

<div>- Zone</div>

<div>- Supplier</div>

<div>- Manufacturer</div>

<div>- Language</div>

<div>- Currency</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>If you choose the percentage type, it can be calculated from Retail or Wholesale price and with or without taxes.</div>

<div>To apply the rule, you have this additional controls:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Minimum threshold price</div>

<div>- Maximum threshold price</div>

<div>- Date From</div>

<div>- Date To</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>And also, you can control the final price result setting a minimum and a maximum price with:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Minimum result price</div>

<div>- Maximum result price</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The module adds a priority system in case that two or more rules must be applied to the same product. In this case, you can establish a priority to set the order and if you want to only execute one of this rules (using the option:</div>

<div>&quot;Apply only one condition&quot;).</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Discounts management</strong></div>

<div>To apply and manage the discounts with our module, you have 3 options:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Show reduction as discount: With this option enabled, the reduction is showed like discount (specific price), then the price of the product will show the old price and the new price with the discount amount/percentage.</div>

<div>* Only works if the rule configuration create with our module is a discount.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Skip other discounts: If the product has a previous discount, the rule will not be applied to this product.</div>

<div>- Override discounts: If the product has a previous discount, the rule will be applied and the previous discount will be overrided (ommitted but not deleted).</div>

<div>This 2 options, are applicable with any of the configurations that you can do with our module.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Examples of using the module</strong><u><strong>:</strong></u></div>

<div>- Very useful for the promotions season like <strong>Black Friday, Sales, Christmas, Cyber Monday</strong>, etc... to <strong>change the prices in the products with begin and end date activating and deactivating the offer automatically.</strong></div>

<div><strong>- You can set an increment in the catalog products only or a currency (or currencies) to avoid the currency conversion losses.</strong></div>

<div><strong>- </strong>Set a <strong>reduction for a VIP customers group </strong>offering them <strong>more competitives prices </strong>or set an<strong> increment to your Resellers group </strong>to get <strong>more benefits from the products.</strong></div>

<div><strong>- Change the prices in a Country or Zone and promote the sales in this geographical area.</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><em>* The module doesn&#39;t change the original price of the product (you never will lose the original price).</em></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>★ &iexcl;New! ★ -&gt; Attributes filter (combinations)</strong></div>

<div>With the new attributes filter you can set the price changes only for an specific product combination.</div>

<div>Example: Modify the price only of your product with the L and XL size and not for the prices of the S and M size.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>★ &iexcl;New! ★ -&gt; Features filter</strong></div>

<div>With the new features filter you can set the price changes only for products with an specific feature.</div>

<div>Example: Modify the price only for the cotton and synthetic products.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>★ &iexcl;New! ★ -&gt; Quantity product units filter</strong></div>

<div>Added a new field to set the m&iacute;nimum quantity units of the product that must be in the cart to apply the change in the price.</div>

<div>Example: Modify the price of product from 3 units, then, the price of product will be changed automatically only if 3 or more products are added to the cart.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>★ &iexcl;New! ★ -&gt; Change the prices within a period (date from and date to)</strong></div>

<div>Configure the price changes (increment, discount or fixed price) between 2 dates, or from a date or until a date. It&#39;s an optional field, is not necessary to set a date, if 0 there&#39;s no period limit to apply the rule.</div>

<div>Example: Apply the modification (increment, discount or fixed price) from 2016-10-20 until 2016-10-30</div>

<div>Example: Apply the modification (increment, discount or fixed price) from 2016-10-20.</div>

<div>Example: Apply the modification (increment, discount or fixed price) until 2016-10-30.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>★ &iexcl;New! ★ -&gt; Threshold prices to apply the rules</strong></div>

<div>Apply the change in your prices only for the product which price is between a threshold.</div>

<div>Example: Apply the modification (increment, discount or fixed price) in the price of products which cost is more than 10&euro; and less than 30&euro;.</div>

<div>Example: Apply the modification (increment, discount or fixed price) in the price of products which cost is more than 50&euro;.</div>

<div>Example: Apply the modification (increment, discount or fixed price) in the price of products which cost is less than 100&euro;.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>★ &iexcl;New! ★ -&gt; Minimum and maximum result price</strong></div>

<div>Now, you can set a minimum and a maximum price to get if the result of the increment or discount is below or above this prices.</div>

<div>Example: Minimum result price = 100 and Maximum result price 200</div>

<div>If the result price after the rule application is below 100&euro; (89&euro; for example), the product price will be 100&euro;. If the result price after the rule application is above 200&euro; (205&euro; for example) the product price will be 200&euro;.</div>

<div>Example: Minimum result price = 100 and Maximum result price 0</div>

<div>If the result price after the rule application is below 100&euro; (89&euro; for example), the product price will be 100&euro;. If the result price after the rule application is 105&euro; the product price will be 105&euro;.</div>

<div>Example: Minimum result price = 0 and Maximum result price 100</div>

<div>If the result price after the rule application is above 100&euro; (105&euro; for example) the product price will be 100&euro;. If the result price after the rule application is 80&euro; the product price will be 80&euro;.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>★ &iexcl;New! ★ -&gt; Category tree to select the categories</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>★ &iexcl;New! ★ -&gt; Friendly multiple selectors interface</strong></div>

<div>New friendly multiple selector interface with add and remove buttons and a search box.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Geolocation compatibility</strong></div>

<div>Full compatibility with Prestashop Geolocation to change the prices by Zone and Country. If the customer is not logged and the Prestashop Geolocation is enabled, the prices will be shown by the geolocation IP Country of the customer.</div>

<div>If logged, the country and the zone calculation is done from the address delivery.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Apply a markup or offer a discount in your products</strong></div>

<div>Feel free to play with a markup in the price of your products creating an increment or a reduction configuration by category, by product, by customer group, by customer, by country, by zone, by supplier and by manufacturer.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Example: You can create a new category, associate the products to this category and with our module you could set all this category products to 20$ without changing the original product price and without creating complicated discount rules to obtain the desired price.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

With our module, you can automate the generation and configuration of your Sitemaps, so you do not have to worry about.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u><strong>4 types of sitemaps</strong></u></div>

<div>Our module is fully-automatic and allows you to create 4 types of sitemaps:</div>

<ul>
	<li>one sitemap that includes all the URLs of your <em>Product</em> pages</li>
	<li>one sitemap that includes all the URLs of your <em>Category</em> pages</li>
	<li>one sitemap that includes all the URLs of your <em>CMS</em> pages</li>
	<li>one sitemap that includes all the URLs of your <em>Manufacturer</em> pages</li>
</ul>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u><strong>Really easy to configure sitemaps</strong></u></div>

<div>Configure each type of sitemap separately.</div>

<ul>
	<li>Choose the type (product, category, CMS or manufacturer)</li>
	<li>Choose the store (multistore)</li>
	<li>Choose the priority of indexation of the urls of the sitemap from 0.1 to 1.0 compared to the urls of your other sitemaps (&quot;priority&quot; tag)</li>
	<li>Indicate how frequently (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) the pages contained into the sitemap are supposed to be modified (&quot;changefreq&quot; tag)</li>
	<li>Choose to include or not the urls of your product, categories and manufacturers images into the sitemap</li>
	<li>Choose to automatically inform or not the search engines Google, Bing and Ask about the sitemap creation (ping request)</li>
</ul>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u><strong>Really easy to generate the sitemaps</strong></u></div>

<div>Click on the button &quot;Generate&quot; and the sitemaps are generated automatically without overloading the server and without timeout problem. Perfect for large, medium and small catalogues of products.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u><strong>Multistore sitemaps</strong></u></div>

<div>This module is compatible with PrestaShop monostore and multistore system. It automatically detects all your stores and allows you to easily generate sitemaps for all of them.</div>

<div>Please note that the module generate different sitemaps by store, each store has its 4 own sitemaps (Products, Categories, CMS and Manufacturers).</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong><u>Multilingual sitemaps</u></strong></div>

<div>Our module allows you to create sitemaps in all the languages of your store so that you can easily improve the SEO of your store in several languages.</div>

<div>For each type of sitemap (products, categories, CMS and manufacturers), the module generates one sitemap that includes the URLS in all languages, as recommended by Google.</div>

<div>Our sitemaps are based on Google official guidelines so that you get the best SEO results.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong><u>Image indexation</u></strong></div>

<div>Another feature of our module is the possibility to include product, categories and manufacturers images into the sitemaps so that Google can index them. It makes your store visible and accessible from Google Image Search, which automatically increases the visibility of your store.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong><u>Sitemap index</u></strong></div>

<div>The module automatically creates a sitemap index to make it easier the management of your sitemaps, as recommended by Google. The index contains all the urls of your sitemaps, you just need to enter the url of the sitemap index into Google Webmaster Tools to submit all your sitemaps at once.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u><strong>Automatic split up of large sitemaps</strong></u></div>

<div>Our module can create sitemaps for all sizes of catalogues. Google only accepts sitemaps that weights up to 10MB or 50,000 urls, this is why our module automatically split up the large sitemaps into several files so that you don&#39;t have any problems in Google.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u><strong>Automatic creation via the Cron</strong></u></div>

<div>You will find inside the module a Cron URL that allows you to generate all your sitemaps automatically and on a regular basis without having to do anything. You just need to copy and paste this url into a Cron module or into your hosting panel to execute these tasks automatically and on a regular basis.</div>

Social Login is robust and easy to install.</div>
";s:21:"additionalDescription";s:5265:"<div><strong>Did you know that one of the main purchase obstacles on the Internet is to have to create a custom account?</strong>&nbsp;With &quot;Social Login&quot; module, boost your conversion rate by letting your customers easily register and log in to your shop through their favorite social network: Facebook, Paypal, Amazon, Google or Twitter.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>REDUCE YOUR ABANDONED CART RATE !</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>This is a known fact in the world of e-commerce that&nbsp;<strong>the less friction there is during checkout, the higher the chance is that the customer will finalize his or her order, considerably reducing cart abandonment.</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Social networks use has largely expanded and is experiencing unprecedented growth. Today there are&nbsp;<strong>more than 3 billion active social network users worldwide.</strong>&nbsp;Use this astounding craze to your advantage!</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Thanks to the &quot;Social Login&quot; module, your customers will be able to register and log in to your shop&nbsp;<strong>in only 1 click</strong>.They&#39;ll just have to connect to their favorite social network, as Facebook, Paypal, Amazon, Google or Twitter. This will make&nbsp;<strong>the ordering process much quicker and easier.</strong>&nbsp;Moreover, with PayPal, it&#39;s a real 1 click registration because PayPal also automatically fills the customer&#39;s shipping/billing address in the customer&#39;s account.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>But it&#39;s not all! If you have a 1.7 PrestaShop version, you can go even further</strong>&nbsp;linking this module with the Presta-Module&#39;s &quot;One Click Order&quot; one (available separately here: https://addons.prestashop.com/en/express-checkout-process/29273-one-click-order.html) and offering to your customers&nbsp;<strong>not only</strong>&nbsp;to log in 1 click but also&nbsp;<strong>to order in 1 click!</strong>&nbsp;Placing an order on your site has never been easier!</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>[NEW] TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TOTAL FREEDOM IN POSITIONING YOUR CONNECTORS</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The module offers you multiple possibilities to position your connectors and even goes so far as to leave your hand completely to precisely place your connection buttons. In fact, in addition to the standard positions (see &quot;Features&quot; section of this product file), such as the user block, the login page or the order funnel (for 1.7 PrestaShop versions), the module offers you two advanced position tools:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>- HTML elements use:</strong>&nbsp;select the HTML element on which you want to see the buttons, fill it in the back office and the module takes care of everything!</div>

<div><strong>- Shortcode use:</strong>&nbsp;for pro, only fill out a configuration form and get the shortcode to insert directly in your theme template.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>[NEW] ENDLESSLY CUSTOMIZE QUICK CONNECTION BLOCKS</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Whether you choose a classic or an advanced position for your connectors, the module offers you&nbsp;<strong>a complete CSS tool</strong>&nbsp;that allows you to&nbsp;<strong>fully customize</strong>&nbsp;the appearance of the connection block. Take advantage of this advanced feature to make your shop visually unique!</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>THE PRESTASHOP SOCIAL LOGIN MODULE THE MOST ROBUST AND GRAPHICALLY CAREFUL</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>This state-of-the-art &quot;Social Login&quot; module was implemented&nbsp;<strong>with the latest standards</strong>&nbsp;of Facebook, PayPal, Amazon, Google and Twitter, insuring&nbsp;<strong>a high level of quality and robustness.</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>We have completely rebuilt the interface of the module to make its configuration&nbsp;<strong>as pleasant and intuitive as possible.</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Finally, we have also&nbsp;<strong>reworked the design of the connection buttons</strong>&nbsp;to allow you to opt for a style of buttons much more modern than before. You have the opportunity to give a resolutely current style to your shop.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS BY OFFERING THEM A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR A CONNECTION THROUGH A SOCIAL NETWORK</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>You want to attract new customers? What better than to offer a voucher in exchange for a quick connection through their favorite social network?&nbsp;<strong>They will not only waste time filling out a registration form</strong>&nbsp;but in addition they will&nbsp;<strong>take advantage of a voucher.</strong>&nbsp;Ordering will be greatly facilitated!</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The module gives you the possibility&nbsp;<strong>to highlight, or not,</strong>&nbsp;this offer in different positions on your website and to fully configure its application conditions&nbsp;<strong>directly from the module&#39;s back office.</strong></div>

";s:21:"additionalDescription";s:6771:"<div>Our module allows you to fully complies with the European Cookie Law / PECR.</div>

<div>Updated to comply with the <strong>latest GDPR modifications of Cookies.</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u><strong>Complete compliance with the GDPR</strong></u></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Besides displaying a warning banner, our module is the only one that allows you to block the cookies when users enter your store. As established by the law, you &quot;<em>shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information</em>.&quot;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Please note that all the other cookie modules sold on Addons only allows you to display a warning banner regardless of the user consent. Cookies are installed on the users&#39; computer without obtaining their consent and regardless of their will.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>It also gives you the option to customize the module to meet 100% with the new requirements of the RGPD (European Union). Our Cookies module complies with the <strong>Right of rectification</strong>, with it users can delete the cookies installed from the site simply by accessing a URL or even from their own customer profile.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u><strong>Main features of the modules</strong></u></div>

<ul>
	<li>Display a warning banner on every page to inform users about the use of cookies and ask for their consent</li>
	<li>Disable a list of modules when users enter the website because warning users about cookies is useless and illegal if you have already installed cookies on their computer.</li>
	<li>Enable these cookies after having obtained their consent or maintain them disabled if they refuse.</li>
	<li>Fully customize the warning banner (color, text, link, font, position, multilingual mode, transparency, buttons...)</li>
</ul>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u><strong>Getting the user consent</strong></u></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The module includes 2 different ways to ask user consent, you can choose between:</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Acceptance through a button</strong>: Users must click on the &quot;I accept&quot; button in the warning banner to give his consent. As soon as users give their consent, the warning banner disappears and all the modules using cookies will get enabled and will work as usual. But if users refuse to give their consent, the disabled modules will remain disabled. We recommend you to use this mode, this one allows you to fully comply with the law.</li>
	<li><strong>Acceptance through the navigation</strong>: (If you choose this option you should know that<strong> it does not comply with the new update of the GDPR</strong>) If users continue browsing the website, they will accept the use of cookies. The warning banner is displayed on the first page on which users arrive with a message like &laquo;&nbsp;By<em> continuing browsing the website, you accept the use of cookies&nbsp;&raquo;. </em>As soon as users decide to go to another page, the banner automatically disappears and the disabled modules will get enabled.</li>
</ul>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Note: the consent remains valid during the period of time set in the module interface (we recommend you not to go over 13 months)</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong><u>IMPORTANT</u></strong>: L&iacute;nea Gr&aacute;fica will in no case be liable for any damages or losses that may be caused by activating options that do not comply with the RGPD.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u><strong>Customizing the banner content and design</strong></u></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>As recommended by the European authority, the module allows you to customize the warning message inside the banner (to inform users about the cookies users and their purpose) and add a &quot;More information&quot; button into the banner that take users to a CMS page of your store (to explain in details the use of cookies on your store).</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The warning banner is responsive and will always be displayed full-width. The module comes with a Wysiwyg editor that allows you to fully customize the content of the banner (font, color, effects, html code, links...). You can also choose from the configuration page the background color of the banner, its percentage of opacity (transparency) and its position (top or bottom of the page). Moreover, the module is multilingual and automatically detects all the languages of your store, which allows you to set a different warning message per language.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Note: the module is designed to not display a warning message when search engines robots crawl you store in order not to affect your SEO.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u><strong>Disabling the modules that use cookies</strong></u></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>This is the only module that allows you to choose the modules/cookies that you want to disable until users give their consent. This feature is compulsory because it is useless and illegal to inform users if you have already installed cookies on their computer with their consent.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&quot;<em>Member States shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information, in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC</em>&rdquo; EU Cookie Law</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>To comply with the directive of the EU Cookie Law, we recommend you to disable the tracking (Google Analytics), social sharing (Facebook &quot; Like &quot;, Google &quot; +1 &quot;, etc.) and targeted advertising modules. Please note that all modules that are required for the good running of your PrestaShop store (ex: basket cookie, session cookie...) don&#39;t require any consents.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u><strong>Multistore mode</strong></u></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The module is compatible with multistore and allows you to display the same notification banner on each one of your shop but the consent is the same for all shops. If you accept the use of cookies on one of your shop, the module will consider that you accept the use of cookies for all your other shops (mention it on your cookie policy) and the notification banner will not be shown when you go to your other shops.</div>

The “Free Delivery Manager” module is actually the perfect solution for offering your respected customers free shipping through objective rules. It is the promise of <strong>a rise in the amount of orders</strong> with total <strong>control of delivery costs</strong>.<br /><br />The module allows you to calculate in advance, with the help of precise rules, the necessary conditions for unlocking free delivery. The management and monitoring are done according to carriers, delivery area, price, weight, or any other criteria you term as important for your business.<br /><br />The “Free Delivery Manager” module offers <strong>control of delivery costs</strong> by releasing delivery available as a function of criteria you have chosen. All the carriers have their own price list. You may, for example, indicate a minimum order amount by carrier<br />In presenting to the customer, in their order summary, the amount remaining before delivery is available, so you definitely encourage them to <strong>order more</strong>.<br /><br />Highly detailed statistics visually present two types of reports together. The first one presents the number of orders that have benefited from free delivery, as well as the total and per-order amount that this cost you. You really <strong>control the impact</strong> of delivery costs.<br />The second report displays the detail of costs caused by free postage and the orders where the rules for free shipping are applied. Thus, the “Free Delivery Manager” module increases the value of transactions as well as the number of orders!<br /><br />This module has been constantly evolving, many thanks to user feedback. TimActive, in fact, grants great importance to your perception of our solutions and of the improvements that can be added. ";s:3:"tab";s:18:"shipping_logistics";s:7:"version";s:6:"1.6.21";s:13:"compatibility";O:8:"stdClass":2:{s:4:"from";s:7:"1.5.0.0";s:2:"to";s:7:"1.7.6.9";}s:7:"nbRates";s:2:"70";s:12:"product_type";s:6:"module";s:7:"avgRate";s:3:"5.0";s:5:"price";O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:3:"EUR";d:89.989999999999995;s:3:"USD";d:109.98999999999999;s:3:"GBP";d:84.989999999999995;}s:6:"badges";a:2:{i:0;O:8:"stdClass":2:{s:5:"label";s:21:"PrestaShop's Favorite";s:3:"img";s:91:"https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/ps-selected.png";}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":2:{s:5:"label";s:23:"Modules Partner Creator";s:3:"img";s:93:"https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png";}}s:5:"cover";O:8:"stdClass":2:{s:5:"small";s:70:"https://medias3.prestastore.com/691962-pprod/free-delivery-manager.jpg";s:3:"big";s:69:"https://medias3.prestastore.com/691962-pbig/free-delivery-manager.jpg";}s:9:"changeLog";O:8:"stdClass":19:{s:5:"1.3.1";a:3:{i:0;s:19:"Improve performance";i:1;s:30:"Fixed bug with handling charge";i:2;s:24:"Fixed checking best rule";}s:5:"1.3.3";a:3:{i:0;s:81:"Feature Possibility if Many rule matching by carrier => best price or best weight";i:1;s:30:"Fixed Better structure css, js";i:2;s:90:"Feature Several matching rules exist for a carrier => possibility to select best free rule";}s:5:"1.3.4";a:1:{i:0;s:73:"#Improve code and error  path Free delivery manager path js and css moved";}s:5:"1.4.0";a:2:{i:0;s:49:"#Condition / check with cart or without cart rule";i:1;s:32:"#Tax handling charge not include";}s:5:"1.4.1";a:1:{i:0;s:26:"Error update configuration";}s:5:"1.4.2";a:1:{i:0;s:50:"Fix bug to calculate free delivery in visitor mode";}s:5:"1.4.4";a:2:{i:0;s:35:"Add link compatibility for 1.6.0.13";i:1;s:37:"Add feature to add information in div";}s:5:"1.4.5";a:1:{i:0;s:19:"Error path ajax.php";}s:5:"1.4.6";a:1:{i:0;s:70:"delete mail reference in php and documentation, update support contact";}s:5:"1.5.2";a:6:{i:0;s:66:"New feature add condition if additionnal shipping cost is included";i:1;s:25:"New feature add statistic";i:2;s:77:"New feature add specific form to update the address to calculate freeshipping";i:3;s:56:"Override is more clean no impact with Prestashop upgrade";i:4;s:36:"Test of configuration has bean added";i:5;s:42:"Delete all  reference of timactive support";}s:5:"1.5.3";a:3:{i:0;s:25:"Bug Fixed / firefox admin";i:1;s:38:"Bug Fixed / state undefined javascript";i:2;s:32:"Bug Fixed / id_group not defined";}s:5:"1.5.4";a:1:{i:0;s:24:"Traduction lost in 1.5.3";}s:5:"1.5.6";a:2:{i:0;s:84:"#FEATURE_MAXIMUM_WEIGHT Add Weight restriction(maximum weight) in free delivery rule";i:1;s:80:"#FEATURE_MAXIMUM_WEIGHT Setting configuration for display the weight restriction";}s:5:"1.6.0";a:2:{i:0;s:41:"Feature multi carrier order compatibility";i:1;s:21:"Add 1.7 compatibility";}s:5:"1.6.1";a:1:{i:0;s:51:"#Feature31 Improve Compatibility for visitor client";}s:5:"1.6.4";a:3:{i:0;s:18:"add fr translation";i:1;s:41:"FIX  visitor issue for address validation";i:2;s:34:"FIX code Prestashop 1.7 compliance";}s:6:"1.6.16";a:1:{i:0;s:28:"Fix compatibility with PHP 7";}s:6:"1.6.17";a:1:{i:0;s:56:"Fix warning error display on prestashop 1.7.5 with php 7";}s:6:"1.6.21";a:1:{i:0;s:50:"Fix cart rule calculation deduction after PS 1.7.4";}}s:6:"origin";s:9:"must-have";s:19:"origin_filter_value";i:2;s:14:"categoryParent";s:20:"Shipping & Logistics";s:17:"version_available";s:6:"1.6.21";s:11:"productType";s:6:"module";}s:12:"migrationpro";O:8:"stdClass":29:{s:2:"id";s:4:"8934";s:4:"name";s:12:"migrationpro";s:11:"displayName";s:49:"MigrationPro: PrestaShop Upgrade and Migrate Tool";s:12:"categoryName";s:23:"Data migration & Backup";s:10:"categoryId";s:3:"431";s:18:"categoryParentName";s:14:"Administration";s:25:"categoryParentEnglishName";s:14:"Administration";s:16:"categoryParentId";s:3:"440";s:11:"description";s:52:"Upgrade PrestaShop 1.4, 1.5 or 1.6 to PrestaShop 1.7";s:6:"author";s:12:"MigrationPro";s:3:"url";s:208:"https://addons.prestashop.com/en/data-migration-backup/8934-migrationpro-prestashop-upgrade-and-migrate-tool.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download";s:3:"img";s:49:"https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/8934.jpg";s:15:"fullDescription";s:314:"<div><strong>Upgrade PrestaShop 1.4, 1.5 or 1.6 to PrestaShop 1.7.x for an instant! </strong>MigrationPro is the <strong>#1</strong> PrestaShop to PrestaShop migration module that helps you migrate <strong>all</strong> your data <strong>and</strong> keep your shop <strong>always fully up-to-date.</strong></div>

Show your visitors relevant ads based on their activity on your site.</div>
";s:21:"additionalDescription";s:1799:"<div>If you want to track the activity of your visitors on your site so that you can then target them on third-party sites with ads based on products seen on your shop, you have found the right module.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&quot;Google Dynamic Remarketing&quot;&nbsp;<strong>automatically</strong>&nbsp;installs the Google Ads remarketing tag on all the pages of your site. This allows you to then serve ads to web users who have already interacted with your site, when they visit other Google partner websites or applications.</div>

<div><strong>But that&#39;s not all!</strong>&nbsp;Our module not only allows you to do classic remarketing, it also sets up&nbsp;<strong>dynamic</strong>&nbsp;remaketing tags. By enabling the feature and creating the link to your products on Merchant Center, you allow Google Ads tag to be much more accurate in its information collection: products, prices, cart amount, detail of products ordered, etc. as much essential data as you can then use to display ads to a former visitor&nbsp;<strong>containing the products that are most likely to interest him/her</strong>: recently viewed products, added to the cart but not ordered, of the same category, etc... A very effective way to get him/her back to place an order on your site and&nbsp;<strong>significantly improve your conversion rate</strong>!</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Our &quot;Google Dynamic Remarketing&quot; module&nbsp;<strong>does not require any technical skill</strong>.

<div>Do you want to eliminate IDs from the URLs of your PrestaShop store, so that links of Ecommerce store become search engine friendly, to get better ranking in search results?</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>PrestaShop Pretty URL module removes automatically generated IDs and numbers from the URLs, so that they could become friendly not only to users, but also to search engine for better ranking. The default URLs of PrestaShop store contains IDs that are not according to the guidelines provided by search engines.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Mostly dynamically generated URLs are meaningless, irrelevant, uninformative and have less potential for higher ranks in search results. For that reason, PrestaShop Search Friendly Pretty URL module cleans the URLs that are user friendly as well as search engine friendly, it replaces randomly generated IDs from website addresses. Rather than using irrelevant characters in address like www.domain.com/1-product-A, the add-on cleans the URL and adds the name of product &amp; service that is offered through the page like www.domain.com/product-A.</div>

Let your customers know the estimated delivery in the product page, in the order process or even in the order emails.</div>
";s:21:"additionalDescription";s:2597:"<div>Estimated Delivery is a module that calculates the delivery date of the products before adding these to the cart. It&#39;s easy to set up and configure and it will help you increase your customers&rsquo; trust as well as your sales.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>You can display carriers in three ways:</div>

<div>1.Carrier list mode: The default mode displays a list of available carriers sorted by the estimated delivery date.</div>

<div>2. The Amazon mode: Calculates and displays the time of the fastest shipping option available (order before xxx &nbsp;and receive it on xxx).</div>

<div>3 Time to picking: Displays the time limit for the picking instead of a standard countdown.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>What Estimated Delivery does?</strong></div>

<div>Increase your sales and trust by letting your customers know when they will receive their order.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>With this module, your customers will know the estimated delivery date even before adding a product to their shopping cart.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Estimated Delivery uses geolocation to find out the location of your visitors and displays the only carriers available to them.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Once the customer is connected, the module uses the saved address to calculate the Estimated Delivery, which increases performance and accuracy.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Estimated Delivery also comes with a wide range of options available to easily configure each parameter, such as style, time format, position and color of the Estimated Delivery information box, without needing to edit a single line of code.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Select Picking Days, Time Limit, Delivery Time, and more. The module comes with extensive documentation to guide you.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>You can also configure holidays and special dates without picking or shipping, and activate or deactivate them with a single click from a single admin screen.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

";s:21:"additionalDescription";s:2315:"<div><strong>What is the products import?</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Adding products to the online store catalog and updating information about products, for example, when price changes, availability, characteristics, when importing data from price list files, compared to manually managing goods, significantly reduces the time required to keep the catalog up to date.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The procedure for importing products in PrestaShop is not easy, even considering the possibility of standard products importing of the platform. The stock import function in PrestaShop is quite confusing and includes a minimum of functions. A functional, quick and convenient method of products management is a perfect choice for a modern state of the online store. Our Product Catalog Import module allows you to easily import and update your product catalog. It allows you to extend the initial import functionality and can be easily configured in a few steps.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Our main product advantages which we are proud of:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Automatic import feature with an email notification</strong>&nbsp;- allows to configure automatic import and get the report about it on your email address.</li>
	<li><strong>Multiple images import &amp; thumbnails generation</strong>&nbsp;- allows importing product images by 2 methods: Images in one field separated by a comma or Each image in a separate field.</li>
	<li><strong>Combinations import methods</strong>&nbsp;- combination in one field, each attribute and value in the separate field, each combination in a separate row in the file, generate combinations from attribute values.</li>
	<li><strong>Categories import</strong>&nbsp;by category name, category ID or category tree.</li>
	<li><strong>Features import</strong>&nbsp;- features name you can enter manually or select from the file.</li>
</ul>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Conclusion</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The module has the necessary functionality to work with the import of a huge amount of data - and if you have a special case and the functionality of the standard version is not enough - we can always discuss the possibility of both free and paid upgrades.</div>

&nbsp;";s:21:"additionalDescription";s:2828:"<u><strong>IQITMEGAMENU is highly customizable responsive menu module.&nbsp;</strong></u><br />
<br />
<strong>Vertical and horizontal menu</strong><br />
With our module you can get both navigations inside only one package. You can also select where to show vertical menu (on the left column or as the expanded menu on horizontal bar). It is possible to make <strong>sticky horizontal menu </strong>(it will follow you when you scroll a page down). You can also choose from 400+ icons or add your owns. Moreover, you can set your own color per each tab, align it right or add extra tag label to make important items more visible!<br />
<br />
<strong>Advanced submenu </strong><br />
No more a single column menu display! This menu ships with Drag&amp;Drop intuitive bootstrap (responsive) grid system to cover all of your categories, sub-categories, manufacturers, image banners, custom html content or even selected products. It includes also individual design controls for each menu item, which is the revolutionary way to creating unique and <strong>beautiful drop down menu</strong>. For every single column, you can set different designs and widths.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Compatible with any 1.6+ themes</strong><br />
Do you use custom theme? No problem! You can decide whether you want to load bootstrap and Font Awesome libraries with module or not.<br />
&nbsp;In the case of troubles connected with implementing <strong>navigation </strong>with your theme, you will get a free support for that!<br />
<br />
<strong>Custom style</strong><br />
You can create unique design of your <strong>mega menu. </strong>There are settings for every part of design, there are <strong>more than 150 design switchers</strong> including typography, colors, backgrounds, borders, box shadows, styles and custom CSS &hellip; you can set this options as global for entire menu or unique per each tab. Also inside submenu you can set unique styles for each column, which you add. It is possible to import and export design configuration. Smooth CSS transitions include (fade, fade with slide, not effect).<br />
<br />
<strong>Tabbed Submenus</strong><br />
It is the only <strong>navigation</strong> on market which has such feature! You can create tabs inside submenu in the same way as you create main items with Drag&amp;Drop and powerful design settings.<br />
<br />
<strong>Responsive and mobile ready</strong><br />
Two types of mobile menu include: push and accordion. They are separated from desktop menu, so you can create advanced category presentation for pc and laptops, and simple for mobiles. You will get support for all mobile devices and browsers (iOS, Android, Windows Phone). You can set different paddings and font sizes of tabs on desktop, which depends on resolution.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
&laquo;&nbsp;The only module of the cart reminder without subscription offering as many features&nbsp;&raquo;<br />
&nbsp;
<div style="text-align:center"><strong><u>** EMAILS OF REMINDER AND OFFERS ABOUT MARKETING ADAPTED TO EACH CART **</u></strong></div>
<br />
Indeed, the module allows you to create &quot;Reminder rules&quot; according to:
<ul>
	<li>Customer information (country, age, gender, group, etc.)</li>
	<li>Cart contents (amount, products, product categories, stock remaining, etc.)</li>
	<li>Time of year (Christmas, New Year&rsquo;s, Valentine&rsquo;s Day, Mothers&rsquo; Day, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>&laquo;&nbsp;No more untimely and inappropriate promotions which let you feel that you are desperate !&nbsp;&raquo;</strong><br />
<br />
With the reminder rules, create easily your own algorithms, for example:<br />
<br />
<strong>Rule 1</strong>&nbsp;: For the cart that exceeds $90, which still contain available items in my stock, the customer is in USA.<br />
Then create a discount coupon to obtain the shipping costs for free.<br />
Reminder1: Send the &laquo;&nbsp;Free shipping costs&nbsp;&raquo; email.<br />
Reminder2: Send the &laquo;&nbsp;Only a few days to benefit from the offer&raquo; email.<br />
------------<br />
<strong>Rule 2</strong>: For the new customers, create a 5% Off Your Order.<br />
Reminder1: 1H after the dropped cart: send the &laquo;To celebrate your arrival 5% Off Your First Order &raquo; email.<br />
Reminder2: 24H after Reminder 1: send the &laquo;&nbsp;Only one day left to take advantage of this offer&raquo; email.<br />
------------<br />
<strong>Rule 3</strong>: From 15/11/2015 to 25/12/2015(Christmas time), create a coupon to obtain a gift on the order.<br />
Reminder 1: Send the &laquo;&nbsp;Surprise Gift&raquo; email.<br />
Reminder 2: Send the &laquo;&nbsp;Only a few days to benefit from the offer&raquo; email.<br />
------------<br />
<strong>Rule 4</strong>: For the cart &gt; &euro;900, the customer is professional<br />
Reminder 1: Send the &laquo;&nbsp;More information about our catalog dedicated to professional&raquo; email.<br />
Reminder 2: Contact the customer by phone<br />
<br />
<em><strong>My interest</strong></em> through Smart Cart Reminder module and the reminder rules:<br />
&rarr; &nbsp;I increase my sales<br />
&rarr; &nbsp;I control the cost of my marketing offers according to the cart<br />
&rarr; &nbsp;I approach as close as possible to the desire of my customers<br />
&rarr; &nbsp;I gain credibility by creating an intelligent and autonomous system which is no longer seen by my customers as an automatic emails or promotion distributor.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<div style="text-align:center"><strong><u>** MANY KINDS OF REMINDER &laquo;&nbsp;STANDARD&raquo; or &laquo;MANUAL&raquo; **</u></strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
Two kinds of reminders to adapt a little more to your reminder process:

<ul>
	<li>&laquo;Standard&raquo;: Sending an automatic email with a custom content of the cart to the customer.</li>
	<li>&laquo;&nbsp;Manual&raquo;: The module notifies you by email to communicate with the customer.</li>
</ul>
You can even set the type of reminder that will suit your cart.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<div style="text-align:center"><strong><u>** AN INTERFACE DEDICATED TO &nbsp;&laquo;&nbsp;MANUAL &raquo; REMINDERS (PHONE) **</u></strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
In one page, the module includes all the information of your customers; and includes many features dedicated for your manual reminders.<br />
<br />
<em><strong>My interest</strong></em> through&nbsp;my module &laquo;&nbsp;Smart Cart Reminder&nbsp;&raquo; and its page dedicated for manual reminders:<br />
&rarr; &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t lose anymore my customers information enabling me converting ( phone number, address, page visited, number of orders placed, current cart &hellip;)<br />
&rarr; I win in reactivity through the features present in this unique page: Sending a Pre-formatted email with the link of the complete order, creation of good (s) reduction (s)<br />
&rarr; I comment all my telephone conversations<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<div style="text-align:center"><strong><u>** ADVANCED STATISTICS&nbsp;**</u></strong><br />
&nbsp;</div>
The module provides a group of advanced reports easy-to-understand:

<ul>
	<li>The evolution of the generated sales according to cart reminders</li>
	<li>Reports about the opened/clicked emails</li>
	<li>Cart reminder rule conversion reports</li>
	<li>Reports on employees manually remind customers. This report contains&nbsp;the number of orders made, the number of manual reminder processed for each employee.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<em><strong>My interest</strong></em> through statistics is to improve me reminder system:<br />
&rarr; &nbsp;I improve my reminder emails to convert the maximum of cart<br />
&rarr; &nbsp;I improve my rules to build an autonomous system<br />
&rarr; &nbsp;I motivate my employees to increase my sales<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<div style="text-align:center"><strong><u>** AN INTUITIVE AND EASY MODULE&nbsp;TO TAKE IN CHARGE **</u></strong><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<em>&laquo;&nbsp;A quick start: Coming from a study conducted in the comb to a Committee of a dozen merchants, the module provides a clear and pleasant interface to use. Because we are committed to place the e-trader at the center of the process when we design our modules&raquo;</em><br />
<br />
The module provides a range of features allowing you to act directly on the abandoned cart, you can manually raise without even that the countdown is finished, see explicit details of the choice of a rule for a cart...<br />
<br />
<em><strong>My interest</strong></em> through its intuitive and transparent interface &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I spot in one glance:<br />
&rarr; The rules applied on the cart on each abandoned cart<br />
&rarr; The time left before the next reminder through the countdown<br />
&rarr; The list of reminders applied on the cart<br />
&rarr; If the reminder email was been seen and clicked<br />
&rarr; If the order was completed<br />
&rarr; &nbsp;...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<div style="text-align:center"><strong><u>** AN OPERATIONAL MODULE IN SOME CLICKS! **</u></strong><br />
&nbsp;</div>
1 Installation in 1 click and intuitive setting in 2 steps:

<div style="margin-left:40px">1. I created my reminder emails, it&rsquo;s easy and fast!<br />
Several templates of emails delivered with the module, customize easily and quickly, select an example, edit the colors, edit the text, and here we go!<br />
2- I create my cart reminder rules and I indicate for each rule the reminder emails to send.&nbsp;</div>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Improve the subscription rate for your shop: </strong><br />
Pop-ins are effective at attracting visitors&rsquo; attention, gaining more clicks than sliders, banners or sign-up panels in the footer (which have a conversion rate of only 0.05%).<br />
The proven results for this tool show increases of between 20% and 1,000% in your subscription rate.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Turn your subscribers into loyal customers:</strong><br />
Offer them a discount voucher for their next purchase in your shop to thank them for subscribing.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Offer a flawless user experience:</strong><br />
Similar to pop-ups but with an improved user experience, pop-ins integrate perfectly with the page where they appear.<br />
Pop Newsletter applies best practices recommended for this advertising method:
<ul>
	<li>Lightbox effect</li>
	<li>Option to close the module window with a simple click outside the pop-in, as well as a cross symbol button for closure in the top right-hand corner.</li>
	<li>Option to specify when the pop-in is activated. This allows your visitor to get to know your site before seeing the pop-in.</li>
	<li>Once your visitor closes the pop-in, it will not be shown again.</li>
	<li>Adaptable to all types of shop, with no need for programming or graphic design skills.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Improve results from your newsletters by increasing your contact base:</strong><br />

<div><strong>EXPORT A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT FEED ON FACEBOOK </strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The &quot;Dynamic Ads + Pixel&quot; module allows you to configure your data feed in an extremely simple and fast way by including only the products and information you want. The advanced exclusion rules system gives you the freedom to create an optimized feed by excluding certain products from your ads. The advanced assignment of custom labels to your products further increases the customization of your data feed and allows you to increase the segmentation possibilities of your catalog.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Product feeds generated and imported in the Facebook Business Manager will allow you:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<ul>
	<li>to automatically supply and keep updated&nbsp;<strong>the shop section of your Facebook page</strong></li>
	<li>to diffuse&nbsp;<strong>product ads</strong>&nbsp;on <strong>Facebook and Instagram</strong> for very targeted audiences</li>
	<li><strong>to identify your products</strong>&nbsp;in your <strong>Facebook and Instagram</strong> publications or stories</li>
</ul>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE WORLD&#39;S MOST ADVANCED ADVERTISING TECHNOLOGY</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Thanks to countless personal information collected on its network, each more accurate than the others, Facebook has&nbsp;<strong>a powerful advertising targeting tool</strong>&nbsp;on which Google can not compete. On the Business Manager interface you have a multitude of options allowing you to create your advertising audiences according to age, sex, family situation, geographical location, interests, groups, liked pages and any other information that Facebook has about its users.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>By installing a tracking tag (Facebook pixel) on your site pages, our module allows you to&nbsp;<strong>further</strong>&nbsp;enhance these audiences. Indeed, this pixel allows you to create audiences based on&nbsp;<strong>your visitor activity (purchases, products seen, carts,...)</strong>.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>It also allows you to enjoy the indisputable efficiency of&nbsp;<strong>dynamic retargeting</strong>. Thus, you can for example to launch ad campaigns that will automatically display to Facebook users, the products they previously viewed on your site, or relevant product recommandations. Business Manager tools will then allow you to analyse the efficiency of these ads (conversion tracking).</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The power of Facebook also allows you&nbsp;<strong>to acquire new customers</strong>&nbsp;by attracting people whose interests are close to your current customers. Indeed, the personal information of the social network users, own by Facebook, is compared to the one of your existing customers. You can therefore display your products to these audiences, which are similar to your clientele.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Last but not least,&nbsp;<strong>the cost</strong>&nbsp;is also typically&nbsp;<strong>lower</strong>&nbsp;than Google&#39;s!</div>

the Dynamic Ads*</div>";s:21:"additionalDescription";s:2826:"<div>With this easy-to-configure module you will be able to export your products and later import it to Facebook to create a Product Catalogue.</div><div> </div><div>The catalogue created can be multilingual and have different prices and currencies for each country, all of this in a single catalogue</div><div> </div><div>With the Facebook Catalogue you can do several things:</div><ul><li><u>Product Ads</u>: Create ads using your Product Catalogue</li><li><u>Instagram Product Tagging</u>: Shop the look. This feature will allow you to tag your catalogue products in your Instagram posts and Stories</li><li><u>Facebook Shop Tab</u>: Link your catalogue with your Facebook page to display all your products in the Shop tab.</li><li><u>Dynamic Ads</u>: If you have a module to track the Facebook events (we do recommend our module Pixel Plus) you can link a pixel with the catalogue to be able to create the Dynamic Ads, the most powerful feature from Facebook & Instagram Ads.</li></ul><div> </div><div> </div><div><b>What are the dynamic Product Ads?</b></div><div>It's an advanced remarketing / retargeting feature from Facebook. Automatically created ads based on the behaviour and interests of your customer. Each customer sees a customized ad for him</div><div> </div><div>Since the Ads are generated dynamically for each customer the campaigns have much less maintenance and a much lower cost and better conversion rates.</div><div> </div><div>Once the customer buys the product the modules sends the necessary data to make that customer don't see the ad any more (unless he shows interest on any of your products again).</div><div> </div><div> </div><div><b>Ease to use and well documented</b></div><div>Every section of the module is well documented, meaning that you won't need any previous experience to configure and use the module.</div><div> </div><div>There are also some advanced options to have a better control with the feeds generation.</div><div> </div><div> And a complete step-by-step guide on how to configure the module, how to create the Product Catalogues and how to configure a Cron Job (a sever side script to automatically update the feed).</div><div> </div><div><b>Errors</b></div><div>The module will also try to check and notify of the errors that Facebook may found when uploading the module making it easier to find and solve.</div><div> </div><div><b>Catalogue Filtering, the Product Sets</b></div><div>Sometimes you don’t want to show all your products in the ads, Facebook has powerful filters to create Product Sets that can later be used for Ads, this way you can exclude all the products you want from your catalogue.</div><div><br></div><div>The number of product sets you can create on Facebook is unlimited and they won’t be lost after each automatic update.</div>";s:3:"tab";s:21:"advertising_marketing";s:7:"version";s:5:"2.1.8";s:13:"compatibility";O:8:"stdClass":2:{s:4:"from";s:7:"1.5.0.0";s:2:"to";s:7:"1.7.7.0";}s:7:"nbRates";s:2:"82";s:12:"product_type";s:6:"module";s:7:"avgRate";s:3:"5.0";s:5:"price";O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:3:"EUR";d:59.990000000000002;s:3:"USD";d:74.989999999999995;s:3:"GBP";d:54.990000000000002;}s:6:"badges";a:1:{i:0;O:8:"stdClass":2:{s:5:"label";s:23:"Modules

Using one of the most frequently used messaging apps in the world. Your customers don&#39;t need to have your phone number in their contacts list. With just one press of a button, the WhatsApp app will open ready for them to send you messages.</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Now compatible with <strong>WhatsApp Business! </strong>Configure your professional number and make the most of the advantages that WhatsApp offers its business users. Your business will be able to interact with your customers easily, using tools to automate, organise and respond quickly to messages. Conventional landlines are supported.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u><strong>WhatsApp is the most popular chat app in more than half of the world.</strong></u></div>

<div>WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in 109 countries, which represents 58% of the 187 countries.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u><strong>WhatsApp Chat is convenient for your customers</strong></u></div>

<div>Many online customers want the help of a person, live, whilst they are doing their shopping. In fact, <strong>most online consumers say that having the possibility of having their questions answered by a person whilst they are shopping online is one of the most important characteristics that an online shop can offer. </strong>&nbsp;An online chat system provides your customers with immediate access to help. Waiting times are much less than a phone call, and customers can carry out other tasks whilst they await your reply.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u><strong>WhatsApp Chat increases sales</strong></u></div>

<div>The key is that <strong>customers have someone who can immediately guide them through a sale if they are confused or if they have a question that can mean a sale is lost.</strong> This helps to eliminate bounces to other sites and assures you that shopping carts end in purchases. It has been proved that such an immediate form of contact like this one, is <strong>one of the measures you can implement in your shop that will turn more of your visits into purchases.</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u><strong>Single payment</strong></u>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The module <strong>does not incur any additional cost</strong>, you only have to make a single payment applicable to the module licence for your shop.</div>

<br />
Whether you&rsquo;re launching a special sale or a new collection, choose one of <strong>the most innovative technologies at this time</strong>, by sending customized messages right to your customers&rsquo; browsers to get their attention and bring them back to your store!<br />
&nbsp;";s:21:"additionalDescription";s:1354:"<strong><em>What is a push notification?</em></strong><br />
Web push notifications are clickable messages sent by a website to subscribers&rsquo; browsers. Users receive notifications even if the site is not open in a browser on their screen.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em>Increase customer opt-in rate</em></strong><br />
Users are increasingly cautious about communicating their personal information online. Offer them the possibility of keeping up with your news <strong>without needing to enter any contact information!</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em>Ensure a send rate of 100% for your messages</em></strong><br />
As opposed to e-mails, <strong>push notifications are not affected by ad-blockers</strong> and spam filters. That way, you can ensure easy delivery of your messages to subscribers and increase the efficiency of your communication campaigns.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em>Increase your store&rsquo;s conversion rate</em></strong><br />
This method is <strong>five times more efficient than e-mail marketing</strong>, with a <strong>read rate of around 80&ndash;90%</strong>. Results have been remarkable and the technology is setting a trend. With simple and attractive content, your customers can view your messages at a glance, <strong>ensuring better reactivity and transformation rates.</strong><br />

";s:21:"additionalDescription";s:2421:"<div><strong>Help your customers find the products they want...</strong></div>

<div style="text-align:justify">Product recommendations are becoming an essential part of e-commerce stores. Not only to solve the task of putting the right product in front of the right customer, but also to improve the store navigation for customers browsing things they are, or could be, interested in. Recommendations help you drive revenue through cross-selling and up-selling, but it also drives revenue by increasing the customer experience on your site. Our recommendations drive an increase in revenue that is often noticeable within a few weeks, along with increase in engagement and time spent on store.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Why using a recommendation engine?</strong></div>

<div style="text-align:justify">The most essential task of a recommender system is to serve up relevant content to the user at the right time. A product recommendation engine provide relevant products to store visitors to increase the likelihood of turning the visitor into a customer. Much like Netflix&#39;s recommender system aims to increase time spent at Netflix by serving up movies and series that the user is likely to want to watch.</div>

<div style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align:justify">It is hard to serve the right product to the right visitor, at the right time. Doing this through featured products or featured categories is often as close to getting it &quot;right&quot; a store owner can get without spending a lot of time on maintaining the &quot;you may also like&quot; section for every product in store. This is impractical and the recommendation engine simply offers a better way of doing it. The algorithm analyses data on customers purchasing patterns and order history to derive the products a visitor is most likely to buy and putting them right in front of them, in real-time. Across all products in the assortment, served every hour, every day.</div>

The GDPR is a new EU legal framework that governs how users&#39; personal data is used. It applies to all automated and manual processing of personal data (i.e., collection, conservation, extraction, use, destruction, etc.).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Personal data is information that is used to identify an individual either directly or indirectly (i.e., first and last name, email address, IP address, telephone number, etc.).<br />

<strong>Why choose our GDPR module?</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
The&nbsp;<strong>Official GDPR Compliance module by PrestaShop</strong>&nbsp;helps you bring your store into compliance with the GDPR. It meets the main obligations of the EU regulations concerning your customers&#39; personal data, including:<br />

	<li>The right to rectification and deletion of their data</li>
	<li>The right to retract their permission if it had been requested</li>
</ul>
