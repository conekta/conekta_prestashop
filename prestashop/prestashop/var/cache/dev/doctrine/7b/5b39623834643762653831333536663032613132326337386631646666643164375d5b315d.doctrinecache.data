Far ahead of its competitors, our module is recommended by the largest e-commerce agencies, on the one hand for its simplicity of configuration and on the other hand for the guarantee of exporting to Google Merchant Center a high quality data feed that meets all Google&#39;s requirements.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>We started from a simple observation: the performance of your Google Shopping ads depends largely on the completeness of the product feed data. The more information you send, the better the results! This&nbsp;<strong>comprehensive<\/strong>&nbsp;module allows you to&nbsp;<strong>maximize your chances of getting good rankings on Google Shopping<\/strong>&nbsp;while&nbsp;<strong>minimizing the time<\/strong>&nbsp;you need to invest in order to achieve this result.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>The module has been developed to allow you to create, step by step, a product data feed for which you are in control of the information. We have included, throughout the configuration, links to precise and complete documentation based on Google&#39;s official regulations. You quickly get a clear product data file that you can export to Google Merchant Center and which you can schedule to be updated automatically at the desired frequency.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>Any questions? Our support department has&nbsp;<strong>many years of experience and a high level of expertise regarding the rather strict constraints and demands of Google Merchant Center,<\/strong>&nbsp;and will be

The management and monitoring are done according to carriers, delivery area, price, weight, or any other criteria you term as important for your business.<br \/><br \/>The \u201cFree Delivery Manager\u201d module offers <strong>control of delivery costs<\/strong> by releasing delivery available as a function of criteria you have chosen. All the carriers have their own price list. You may, for example, indicate a minimum order amount by carrier<br \/>In presenting to the customer, in their order summary, the amount remaining before delivery is available, so you definitely encourage them to <strong>order more<\/strong>.<br \/><br \/>Highly detailed statistics visually present two types of reports together. The first one presents the number of orders that have benefited from free delivery, as well as the total and per-order amount that this cost you. You really <strong>control the impact<\/strong> of delivery costs.<br \/>The second report displays the detail of costs caused by free postage and the orders where the rules for free shipping are applied. Thus, the \u201cFree Delivery Manager\u201d module increases the value of transactions as well as the number of orders!<br \/><br \/>This module has been constantly evolving, many thanks to user feedback.

The Amazon mode: Calculates and displays the time of the fastest shipping option available (order before xxx &nbsp;and receive it on xxx).<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>3 Time to picking: Displays the time limit for the picking instead of a standard countdown.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>What Estimated Delivery does?<\/strong><\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>Increase your sales and trust by letting your customers know when they will receive their order.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>With this module, your customers will know the estimated delivery date even before adding a product to their shopping cart.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>Estimated Delivery uses geolocation to find out the location of your visitors and displays the only carriers available to them.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>Once the customer is connected, the module uses the saved address to calculate the Estimated Delivery, which increases performance and accuracy.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>Estimated Delivery also comes with a wide range of options available to easily configure each parameter, such as style, time format, position and color of the Estimated Delivery information box, without needing to edit a single line of code.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>Select Picking Days, Time Limit, Delivery Time, and more.

The stock import function in PrestaShop is quite confusing and includes a minimum of functions. A functional, quick and convenient method of products management is a perfect choice for a modern state of the online store. Our Product Catalog Import module allows you to easily import and update your product catalog.

the report about it on your email address.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Multiple images import &amp; thumbnails generation<\/strong>&nbsp;- allows importing product images by 2 methods: Images in one field separated by a comma or Each image in a separate field.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Combinations import methods<\/strong>&nbsp;- combination in one field, each attribute and value in the separate field,

Not only to solve the task of putting the right product in front of the right customer, but also to improve the store navigation for customers browsing things they are, or could be, interested in. Recommendations help you drive revenue through cross-selling and up-selling, but it also drives revenue by increasing the customer experience on your site. Our recommendations drive an increase in revenue that is often noticeable within a few weeks, along with increase in engagement and time spent on store.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>Why using a recommendation engine?<\/strong><\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">The most essential task of a recommender system is to serve up relevant content to the user at the right time. A product recommendation engine provide relevant products to store visitors to increase the likelihood of turning the visitor into a customer. Much like Netflix&#39;s recommender system aims to increase time spent at Netflix by serving up movies and series that the user is likely to want to watch.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">It is hard to serve the right product to the right visitor, at the right time. Doing this through featured products or featured categories is often as close to getting it &quot;right&quot; a store owner can get without spending a lot of time on maintaining the &quot;you may also like&quot; section for every product in store. This is impractical and the recommendation engine simply offers a better way of doing it. The algorithm analyses data on customers purchasing patterns and order history to derive the products a visitor is most likely to buy and putting them right in front of them, in real-time. Across all products in the assortment, served every hour, every day.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>An Engage account is required and additional fees may apply.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>Monthly plans start at $7 \/mo and include 7 days free trial (no credit card required).<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>Get more information about our pricing here: engage.zubi.ai<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n","tab":"merchandizing","version":"1.0.2","compatibility":{"from":"1.6.1.0","to":"1.7.7.0"},"nbRates":"4","product_type":"module","avgRate":"4.5","price":{"EUR":0,"USD":0,"GBP":0},"badges":[{"label":"Official Partner","img":"https:\/\/medias2.prestastore.com\/themes\/prestastore\/img\/front\/sprites\/badges\/ps-official-partner.png"}],"cover":{"small":"https:\/\/medias2.prestastore.com\/1422277-pprod\/product-recommendations-by-engage.jpg","big":"https:\/\/medias2.prestastore.com\/1422277-pbig\/product-recommendations-by-engage.jpg"},"changeLog":{"1.0.0":["Initial version"],"1.0.1":["Bug Fix: Fixes an issue in where images did not display correctly in v1.6.1.24"],"1.0.2":["Bug Fix: Fixes an issue in where orders are sometimes tracked incorrectly."]}},{"id":"49266","name":"bdroppy","displayName":"BDroppy- The best brands for your dropshipping business","categoryName":"Marketplace & Affiliation Platforms","categoryId":"74","categoryParentName":"PrestaShop Modules","categoryParentEnglishName":"PrestaShop Modules","categoryParentId":"2","description":"Import thousands of top branded products into your store in just a few clicks and manage your entire business in dropshipping with a single dashboard","author":"PrestaShop Partners","url":"https:\/\/addons.prestashop.com\/en\/marketplace-prestashop-modules\/49266-bdroppy-the-best-brands-for-your-dropshipping-business.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download","img":"https:\/\/medias1.prestastore.com\/img\/pico\/49266.jpg","fullDescription":"<div>Import thousands of top branded products into your store in just a few clicks and manage your entire business in dropshipping with a single dashboard.
