Discover Advanced Pack 5]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[Allow the purchase of combinations of products with or without a discount, in one click Would you like to increase your average shopping cart and at the same time, allow your customers to save money if they purchase several products simultaneously?It is now possible thanks to Advanced Pack ! Without waiting any longer, you can create packs of products that can be purchased in one click, without worrying about stock or their combinations. A precious additional sales tool Accompany your customers in their buying process, by offering them packs of coherent products that you will have predefined, just as the salesman in a real shop would do.Such as for example: this fantastic camera, memory card and tripod. You know that this selection is appropriate and that it will appeal to your customers. Or you could even use your best-sellers, by adding them to those that are less visible, to allow your customers to discover them. Your packs will need to be made up of 2 products minimum, the number is unlimited.Push the quantity per product, choose the combinations of your choice, there are multiple options allowing you to multiply the possibilities. Would you like to reserve the purchase of a product within a pack?That is also possible! You will therefore be able to offer a free product if it is purchased as part of a pack. The possibilities are infinite! Integrated assistant It isn't always obvious deciding which products should be offered within a pack. Here again Advanced Pack has the solution to the problem.When creating your pack, our module will supply you with strategic information, like the number of products sold or their available stock. There is also an integrated dynamic price simulator for your pack, to help you see more clearly when creating your business operation. Remain the maestro of combinations One of the products that you have added to your pack is available in several colors, but you don't want to offer them all in this set?Advanced Pack will allow you to do this. You will also have the possibility of predefining a combination by default, for each of the products of your pack, even if it's different to the one defined in your catalog. Your customers will then be able to personalise their selection amongst the characteristics that you will have chosen to integrate in the offer. Business Incentive Incentive is something that motivates your visitor to make a purchase The main aim is to convince more of your site visitors to finish their order and/or spend more money per transaction.Perhaps you have already tried, by offering free delivery over a certain amount of purchases, or to offer discounts on certain products or even to send discount vouchers?All of these methods work, but their range is limited, as these promotions are usually temporary due to their excessive cost!Stop looking, you have already found the solution ! To entice your customers, Advanced Pack will give you the choice of applying a discount when all the products in the shopping cart are ordered, thus encouraging the purchase of the whole pack. 3 possibilities are available: Offer a specific discount on each product in the packApply a general discount on the set of productsApply a fixed price, such as a psychological price, for example Advanced Pack will also be able to manage the discounts already applied to your products, allowing you to integrate them in the pack price, or on the contrary, to exclude them, in order to choose the predefined discount on the pack.This decision will be made even easier thanks to our clear and clean-looking interface, that will allow you to see the discounted products very easily. You won't need to worry about the coherence of your prices anymore Have you ever had to review all the prices in your catalog, to detect any possible incoherences and correct them? What would happen if you had to manually manage the repercussions of these changes in product pricing in your packs? This would represent a significant extra workload if if it's not anticipated within the choice of management solutions within your packs! Once again Advanced Pack has the solution. By default, in the case where no reduction has been applied, the pack price is the sum of the products making it up.Should you need to modify the price of a product after having created the pack, the pack price will automatically be updated, and without you having to intervene. In those cases where you will apply a discount to one or more products in an existing pack, and on condition you have authorized the promotional implications, the pack price will also be changed, showing your customers the discount that has been applied. Is one of the products of your pack subject to an green-tax? No problem, it will automatically be reflected in the pack price and will be clearly stated, guaranteeing absolute respect for the legislation. Regarding the management of your stock, everything has been automated! For each pack ordered, the product stocks it contains will be automatically deducted. This way you will avoid the double management of stock or the frustration generated by sales rendered impossible, due to the bad assignation of quantities.Also, in the case where a product in a pack is out of stock, it will automatically be displayed as unavailable for purchase thanks to an availability warning system that is both elegant and modern. For your customers, we have integrated a graphic and fun notification system, allowing the instant identification of stock shortages on combinations or products making up the pack. There's no chance of you receiving orders for products that are out of stock ! Highlight your packs and sell more Once you have defined your pack, you will be able to configure it in the same way as you would a classic product. Everything is possible, such as assigning it customized images, classing it in the category of your choice, optimizing your SEO, writing a customized description, attributing it an EAN code or a specific reference, configuring its volume to calculate delivery costs, etc... For those that are pressed for time, and in order to facilitate their marketing, Advanced Pack will automatically display all the photos of the products that make it up, as well as their descriptions, in the form of tabs.Your customers will be correctly informed, without leaving the page of your pack, and able to finalise their purchase in one click. And that's not all... For more visibility, your packs will automatically be highlighted on their data sheets for those being sold in lotsThis way, you will encourage your customers to order the pack, rather than the product they were initially interested in. Essentially, this is cross-selling: an accessible method of increasing your average shopping cart ! We don't forget designers From the beginning, we have integrated the fact that this module should be easily adapted by your web agency or designer/integrator.The module adapts itself perfectly to the default PrestaShop 1.6 and 1.7 themes, whilst allowing the most advanced graphic personalization. A set of JavaScript templates and CSS style sheets are delivered as models with the module, to facilitate the integration process. Either yourself or your integrator will therefore be able to use all of the functionalities of the Advanced Pack 5 engine, in order to present them in the graphic form that will best correspond with the general atmosphere of your online store.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[merchandizing]]></tab><version><![CDATA[5.2.11]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.1.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.6.9]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[299.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[369.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[279.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/616235-pprod/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/616235-pbig/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[1048]]></id><name><![CDATA[facebookpsshoptab]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Advanced Shop for Fan Page]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Products on Facebook & Social Networks]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Create a multilingual, multicurrency and completely customized Facebook shop.

It allows you to display your products in sale on your site directly on the most popular social network. Then, you make the most of your Facebook community to boost the traffic on your PrestaShop site. Contrary to the native shop tab, that has many constraints, the "Advanced Shop for Fan Page" module allows you to: create a completely customized Facebook shop, whether in terms of design, menu type or displaycreate a multilingual and multicurrency shopnot need to submit your products to Facebook for review in order to make them visible for the publicmake the PrestaShop website's modifications instantly visible on the Facebook shop (changes of price, product image,...)display featured categories on the home pagedisplay on Facebook the average rating of each product/category, given on your site (with the shape of stars) if you also have installed on your Prestashop our product rating "Customer Ratings and Reviews Pro + Google Rich Snippets" module (available here: https://addons.prestashop.com/en/seo-natural-search-engine-optimization/6144-customer-ratings-and-reviews-pro-google-rich-snippets.html)  Notes: (x) 1/ So that real-time harmonization between Facebook and your online store is possible, the module has to create a new custom "shop" tab, independent of the default "shop" tab already installed by Facebook on your page. 2/ if you want to create Facebook catalogs and tag your products on Facebook and Instagram, you should choose our "Dynamic Ads + Pixel" module instead, that is available here: https://addons.prestashop.com/en/remarketing-shopping-cart-abandonment/23671-dynamic-ads-pixel.html. 3/ Facebook mobile app does not allow custom tabs insertion, like the one created by our module. Therefore, this latter can only be displayed on the Facebook web version. If you want to see your Facebook shop on mobile, you have to choose our "Dynamic Ads + Pixel" module (available here: https://addons.prestashop.com/en/remarketing-shopping-cart-abandonment/23671-dynamic-ads-pixel.html) in order to import your products into the native Facebook shop tab (however you will not be able to customize the shop).  To know more about the difference between the Facebook native shop tab (and filled by our "Dynamic Ads + Pixel" module) and the custom tab set by our "Advanced Shop for Fan Page" module, read our detailed comparison at this address: https://faq.businesstech.fr/en/faq/230  ]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[social_networks]]></tab><version><![CDATA[5.2.7]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.7.0]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[79.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[99.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[74.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/963149-pprod/advanced-shop-for-fan-page.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/963149-pbig/advanced-shop-for-fan-page.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[1768]]></id><name><![CDATA[gmerchantcenter]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Google Merchant Center (Google-Shopping + Actions)]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Price Comparison]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Export your products on Google Merchant Center]]></description><author><![CDATA[Business Tech]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/price-comparison/1768-google-merchant-center-google-shopping-actions.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/1768.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Export your products on Google Merchant Center.

In addition, you can choose the character to be displayed between the values of the same feature. If you also use our "Advanced Search 4" filters module (available here: https://addons.prestashop.com/en/search-filters/2778-advanced-search-4-filters-search.html), you further increase the search relevance in your catalog. Our module is also compatible with the PrestaShop faceted search (block layered) native module.  Import your features and their multiple values in bulk action! Use the PrestaShop native CSV import tool to assign in bulk, and in a specific order, feature values to your products. In your "Products" CSV import file, use the "Feature(Name:Value:Position)" column to define for each feature the values to be assigned to each product. Indicate in the module configuration the character used to separate the different values and that's it! Example: Separator used: |Material:Yellow gold|White gold,Type of gemstone:Diamond This product will therefore be assigned 2 values of the feature "Material", and a single value of the feature "Type of gemstone".]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[search_filter]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.5.3]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.6.9]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[49.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[64.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[49.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias3.prestastore.com/1367793-pprod/multiple-features-assign-your-features-without-limit.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias3.prestastore.com/1367793-pbig/multiple-features-assign-your-features-without-limit.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[6946]]></id><name><![CDATA[invoicepayment]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Invoice Payment ]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Payment by Invoice]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[The payment by invoice is very popular in many countries, especially among German and Swiss customersWith this module, you can offer the invoice payment method to your registered customers in order to]]></description><author><![CDATA[Silbersaiten]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/payment-invoice/6946-invoice-payment.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/6946.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[The payment by invoice is very popular in many countries, especially among German and Swiss customersWith this module, you can offer the invoice payment method to your registered customers in order to provide a safe shopping experience.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[With this module, you can offer a bill payment to your users.

As established by the law, you "shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information." Please note that all the other cookie modules sold on Addons only allows you to display a warning banner regardless of the user consent. Cookies are installed on the users' computer without obtaining their consent and regardless of their will. It also gives you the option to customize the module to meet 100% with the new requirements of the RGPD (European Union). Our Cookies module complies with the Right of rectification, with it users can delete the cookies installed from the site simply by accessing a URL or even from their own customer profile. Main features of the modulesDisplay a warning banner on every page to inform users about the use of cookies and ask for their consentDisable a list of modules when users enter the website because warning users about cookies is useless and illegal if you have already installed cookies on their computer.Enable these cookies after having obtained their consent or maintain them disabled if they refuse.Fully customize the warning banner (color, text, link, font, position, multilingual mode, transparency, buttons...) Getting the user consent The module includes 2 different ways to ask user consent, you can choose between:Acceptance through a button: Users must click on the "I accept" button in the warning banner to give his consent. As soon as users give their consent, the warning banner disappears and all the modules using cookies will get enabled and will work as usual. But if users refuse to give their consent, the disabled modules will remain disabled. We recommend you to use this mode, this one allows you to fully comply with the law.Acceptance through the navigation: (If you choose this option you should know that it does not comply with the new update of the GDPR) If users continue browsing the website, they will accept the use of cookies. The warning banner is displayed on the first page on which users arrive with a message like « By continuing browsing the website, you accept the use of cookies ». As soon as users decide to go to another page, the banner automatically disappears and the disabled modules will get enabled. Note: the consent remains valid during the period of time set in the module interface (we recommend you not to go over 13 months) IMPORTANT: Línea Gráfica will in no case be liable for any damages or losses that may be caused by activating options that do not comply with the RGPD. Customizing the banner content and design As recommended by the European authority, the module allows you to customize the warning message inside the banner (to inform users about the cookies users and their purpose) and add a "More information" button into the banner that take users to a CMS page of your store (to explain in details the use of cookies on your store). The warning banner is responsive and will always be displayed full-width. The module comes with a Wysiwyg editor that allows you to fully customize the content of the banner (font, color, effects, html code, links...). You can also choose from the configuration page the background color of the banner, its percentage of opacity (transparency) and its position (top or bottom of the page). Moreover, the module is multilingual and automatically detects all the languages of your store, which allows you to set a different warning message per language. Note: the module is designed to not display a warning message when search engines robots crawl you store in order not to affect your SEO. Disabling the modules that use cookies This is the only module that allows you to choose the modules/cookies that you want to disable until users give their consent. This feature is compulsory because it is useless and illegal to inform users if you have already installed cookies on their computer with their consent. "Member States shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information, in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC” EU Cookie Law To comply with the directive of the EU Cookie Law, we recommend you to disable the tracking (Google Analytics), social sharing (Facebook " Like ", Google " +1 ", etc.) and targeted advertising modules. Please note that all modules that are required for the good running of your PrestaShop store (ex: basket cookie, session cookie...) don't require any consents. Multistore mode The module is compatible with multistore and allows you to display the same notification banner on each one of your shop but the consent is the same for all shops. If you accept the use of cookies on one of your shop, the module will consider that you accept the use of cookies for all your other shops (mention it on your cookie policy) and the notification banner will not be shown when you go to your other shops.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[administration]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.4.24]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.5.0.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.7.0]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[49.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[64.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[49.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/1450875-pprod/eu-cookie-law-gdpr-banner-blocker-update-2020.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/1450875-pbig/eu-cookie-law-gdpr-banner-blocker-update-2020.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[8741]]></id><name><![CDATA[dmulistecommandes]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[DMU Improved Order List]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Order Management]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Save time on the processing of your orders!

Highly detailed statistics visually present two types of reports together. The first one presents the number of orders that have benefited from free delivery, as well as the total and per-order amount that this cost you. You really control the impact of delivery costs.

Think of how long it takes to receive an order from your customers, process the order by adding the products to the package, then connect to your shipping carrier`s software and manually insert the customer information, parcel information and delivery address for the order, for each order at a time. This is very time consuming and it`s very easy to make mistakes because you have a lot of data to process.  With this module all of this is done automatically via the API (Application Programming Interface) that connects the orders section in prestashop with the carrier and instantly sends the information to the carrier, then prints the shipping label which is then slicked to the package.

When a new customer wants to place an order on your shop, you have to ask them for their delivery and invoicing address. Your customers find this compulsory and repetitive step annoying and frustrating. Some customers give up and go to another site where they know they have already entered all their information. What is more, shipping errors caused by customers entering their addresses incorrectly are not uncommon, entailing additional transport costs and decreased customer satisfaction owing to the delays caused by their parcels being sent out and returned again.

The advanced exclusion rules system gives you the freedom to create an optimized feed by excluding certain products from your ads.

On the Business Manager interface you have a multitude of options allowing you to create your advertising audiences according to age, sex, family situation, geographical location, interests, groups, liked pages and any other information that Facebook has about its users.&nbsp;By installing a tracking tag (Facebook pixel) on your site pages, our module allows you to&nbsp;further&nbsp;enhance these audiences. Indeed, this pixel allows you to create audiences based on&nbsp;your visitor activity (purchases, products seen, carts,...).&nbsp;It also allows you to enjoy the indisputable efficiency of&nbsp;dynamic retargeting. Thus, you can for example to launch ad campaigns that will automatically display to Facebook users, the products they previously viewed on your site, or relevant product recommandations. Business Manager tools will then allow you to analyse the efficiency of these ads (conversion tracking).&nbsp;The power of Facebook also allows you&nbsp;to acquire new customers&nbsp;by attracting people whose interests are close to your current customers. Indeed, the personal information of the social network users, own by Facebook, is compared to the one of your existing customers. You can therefore display your products to these audiences, which are similar to your clientele.&nbsp;Last but not least,&nbsp;the cost&nbsp;is also typically&nbsp;lower&nbsp;than Google&#39;s!]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[advertising_marketing]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.3.16]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.7.0]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[99.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[124.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[94.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Conversion: Agencies&#39; choice"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/awards-convert-agency.png]]></badge><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/1412117-pprod/dynamic-ads-pixel-facebook-shops.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/1412117-pbig/dynamic-ads-pixel-facebook-shops.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[24239]]></id><name><![CDATA[facebookproductsfeed]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Products Feed: Dynamic Ads & Shop & Tagging]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[SEA SEM (paid advertising) & Affiliation Platforms]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Creates a Product Catalogue to use with Facebook & Instagram]]></description><author><![CDATA[Smart Modules]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/sea-paid-advertising-affiliation-platforms/24239-products-feed-dynamic-ads-shop-tagging.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/24239.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Creates a Product Catalogue to use with Facebook & Instagram.  Create Product Ads, use Instagram product tagging feature, display your products on your Facebook page, be ready for the Dynamic Ads*]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[With this easy-to-configure module you will be able to export your products and later import it to Facebook to create a Product Catalogue. The catalogue created can be multilingual and have different prices and currencies for each country, all of this in a single catalogue With the Facebook Catalogue you can do several things:Product Ads: Create ads using your Product CatalogueInstagram Product Tagging: Shop the look.

You will also be able to give your customers the possibility to pre-pay their subscription for a certain period, in exchange, for example, for a discount. This module automatically installs for you, all the necessary mechanics to manage your subscriptions. Its extremely flexible operation allows you to define your own rules thanks to a series of relevant options. As for your customers, they enjoy a space allowing them to freely manage their subscriptions, directly through their account. OPT FOR THE MOST ATTRACTIVE BUSINESS MODEL OF THE MOMENT! Subscriptions are becoming an increasingly important part of our consumption habits. Peace of mind, saving time and money, the advantages are numerous and in 2019, 85% of European consumers took out at least 1 subscription. As a merchant, offering a subscription to your products ensures you recurring revenues and allows you to anticipate needs, reduce losses and therefore have a better cost management. In addition, because of the automatic renewal of orders, the subscription facilitates the loyalty of your customers. RELY ON A ROBUST AND FLEXIBLE MODULE Thanks to "Advanced Subscription" you can easily integrate the subscription into your business model. Once the module is installed, a multitude of options help you create your own rules for managing recurring orders. Among other things, you can give your customers more or less freedom, for example by allowing them to choose their renewal date or by imposing it according to your logistical constraints. Subscription sales are managed independently for each of the products in your catalog, so you can offer the subscription for some products and not others, or even sell a product on subscription only. OFFER PRE-PAYMENT AND SIMPLIFY YOUR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT The module gives you the possibility to activate the pre-payment of subscriptions. This allows you to ensure the payment of orders for a certain period of time and to have a better control of the stock of products. In order to encourage your customers to pay in advance, you will be able to offer them different types of discounts! NO NEED TO INSTALL PAYMENT MODULES, "ADVANCED SUBSCRIPTION" INTEGRATES THEM FOR YOU The module comes with a list of payment modules already integrated, including the Stripe and PayPlug modules allowing the automatic renewal of payments (minimum "Pro" offer required for PayPlug). You will just have to enter your merchant account IDs (see information and pricing on https://stripe.com/fr/ and https://www.payplug.com/fr/) and the payment methods will be automatically installed on your site.

Instead, the merchant purchases inventory as needed from a third party   to fulfill orders.

With nearly 190 million active users per day, Snapchat has become the number one social network among 18-34 year olds thanks to its interactive and fun content that differs from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter standard formats. Moreover, faced with strong competition from brands that promote their products on major networks such as Facebook or Twitter, it has now become difficult to stand out and capture the attention of users. With fewer advertisers in Snapchat, it is much easier to get known and attract new customers to your site. Do you already advertise on other social networks such as Facebook or Instagram? Take advantage of Snapchat's innovative advertising formats and low competition to make yourself known to a new audience.  With the Snap Pixel, optimize the delivery of your ads to the Snapchatters who are most likely to purchase your products. Then track your campaigns effect by analyzing the number of actions (product view, add to cart, purchase,...) performed by Snapchatters on your site after interacting with your ad.Finally, and once you have reached the required threshold of interactions between Snapchatters and your site (https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/en-US/a/snap-pixel-faq#Audiences), use one of the most interesting features of the pixel, dynamic remarketing. Create custom audiences based on the Snapchatters' activity on your site and then capture their attention again on the social network with targeted ads to encourage them to return to your shop.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[advertising_marketing]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.0.1]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.7.0]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[49.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[64.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[49.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/1407910-pprod/snapchat-ads-pixel.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/1407910-pbig/snapchat-ads-pixel.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[47928]]></id><name><![CDATA[weglot]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Translate Your Store - Weglot]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[International & Localization]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Translate your PrestaShop store into multiple languages in minutes with Weglot]]></description><author><![CDATA[PrestaShop Partners]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/international-localization/47928-translate-your-store-weglot.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/47928.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Translate your PrestaShop store into multiple languages in minutes with Weglot.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[Weglot helps you to grow and increase your business by adding new languages to your store in minutes.&nbsp;As a store owner, you would like to:Increase your sales by acquiring new customersImprove conversion by speaking your visitors&rsquo; language&nbsp;Thanks to Weglot, you&rsquo;ll be able to:Easily translate and display your website in new languagesAutomatically redirect your store to their preferred language&nbsp;Weglot is the best &amp; easiest translation solution to take your PrestaShop store multilingual.

Recommendations help you drive revenue through cross-selling and up-selling, but it also drives revenue by increasing the customer experience on your site. Our recommendations drive an increase in revenue that is often noticeable within a few weeks, along with increase in engagement and time spent on store.&nbsp;Why using a recommendation engine?The most essential task of a recommender system is to serve up relevant content to the user at the right time. A product recommendation engine provide relevant products to store visitors to increase the likelihood of turning the visitor into a customer. Much like Netflix&#39;s recommender system aims to increase time spent at Netflix by serving up movies and series that the user is likely to want to watch.&nbsp;It is hard to serve the right product to the right visitor, at the right time. Doing this through featured products or featured categories is often as close to getting it &quot;right&quot; a store owner can get without spending a lot of time on maintaining the &quot;you may also like&quot; section for every product in store. This is impractical and the recommendation engine simply offers a better way of doing it.
